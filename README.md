# Networking Labs – Cisco Packet Tracer Projects

Welcome! This repository contains hands-on networking labs created as part of my coursework at the University of Central Florida (UCF), using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 🔧 Lab: Ethernet Patch Cable & Basic Network Setup

**Objective:**  
Build a simple local network using Cisco Packet Tracer and a physical Ethernet patch cable to understand Layer 1 (Physical Layer) of the OSI model.

### 🛠 Skills & Concepts Demonstrated
- OSI Model: Focus on Layer 1
- Ethernet patch cable creation using T-568B pinout standard
- Device interconnection using a network switch
- IP address assignment (192.168.5.0/24)
- Verifying connectivity with `ping` commands
- Modeling and testing in Cisco Packet Tracer

### 📁 Files Included
- `Lab2-Jeremy-Rivera.pkt`: Packet Tracer file with two-PC switch network
- `lab 2 succesful ping and model.png`: Screenshot of network topology
- `ping-results.png`: Screenshot showing successful ping

### 🚀 How to Open
To view and interact with the `.pkt` file:
1. Download and install [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).
2. Open the `.pkt` file in Packet Tracer.
3. Explore the network and test connectivity.
